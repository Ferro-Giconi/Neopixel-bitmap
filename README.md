# Neopixel-bitmap
A Raspberry Pi Pico program to display images on a Neopixel RGB LED array.

Instructions:

1. Use BitmapToArray.py on your computer to convert bitmaps into arrays. Save those arrays to BitmapData.py following or replacing the existing examples.

2. Make sure your Pico/2040 device has MicroPython on it.

3. Add custom code for animations to the animations section in main.py

4. Make sure to set number_of_animations to the number of animations so it knows how many to loop through when pushing the buttons

5. Flash main.py and BitmapData.py to your RPi Pico/2040 device.

(Images or schematics or something to show how to connect all the hardware together will come later)
